## Como Es El Clima?

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## App Functionality

## Deployed App

## Future Usage

I'd like to add a feature that allows the user to send the forecast results to their email. <br>
I'd like for my styling to be more polished: search history buttons aligned to the left side of the page, header text centered in the middle of image instead of top and for an error message to display on the page if user misspells a city name
